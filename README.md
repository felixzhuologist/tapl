OCaml implementation of Pierce's Types and Programming Languages textbook. Aims to
be as simple as possible, with each chapter implemented incrementally in a separate
branch to make it easier to follow along with the text.

## building
using version 4.06.1:
```  
make
```

## running tests
```
./main.native examples.tlc
```
